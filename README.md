# Python for Data Science and Machine Learning
This repository contains the coursework for the [Python for Data Science and Machine Learning Bootcamp](https://www.udemy.com/python-for-data-science-and-machine-learning-bootcamp/learn/v4/overview).
The course uses Jupyter Notebooks, but I've chosen to use PyCharm, as I'll use it for future projects and want to become
comfortable with it.
